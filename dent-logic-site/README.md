# Dent Logic Inc — Website

A lightweight, single-page site for Greg's PDR business.

## Quick start in VS Code

1. **Download** this folder (`dent-logic-site`) to your machine.
2. Open the folder in **VS Code** (`File → Open Folder…`).
3. Install the VS Code extension **Live Server** (by Ritwick Dey).
4. Right–click `index.html` → **Open with Live Server** to preview at `http://localhost:5500` (or similar).

## Customize

- Replace the logo URL in `index.html` (`<img class="logo" src="...">`) with a local file if you have one, e.g. `./assets/logo.png`.
- To enable the email form, sign up at [Formspree](https://formspree.io), create a form, then replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` in the form `action`.
- Update phone, areas served, and links as needed.
- All styling is in `styles.css`.

## Deploy options

- **GitHub Pages**: Create a repo, push these files, then enable Pages (root). Your site will be `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`.
- **Netlify or Vercel**: Drag-and-drop the folder in their dashboard for instant hosting.
- **Custom domain**: Point your domain to the chosen host and set the site root to this folder.
